/*a) First, write a program that simply prints all files and directories under
the current working directory, one line per file or directory, along with a "f"
or "d" at the beginning depending on whether it is a file or directory. 

For example, suppose the current directory has a file f0 and a directory d in
it.  Suppose d has 2 files under it, f1 and f2, and a subdirectory d1, and d1
further contains a single file, f3.  Then your program should print the following.

f /f0
d /d
f /d/f1
f /d/f2
d /d/d1 
f /d/d1/f3

The order of printing does not matter, but all files and directories should be listed.
The full path of the file from the root of the file system should be printed.
